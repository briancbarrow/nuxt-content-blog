# Nuxt Content

Nuxt by itself is a powerful tool for creating websites and applications. Part of what makes it powerful is the ability it gives us to use modules to enhance the capabilities of the framework.

A popular Nuxt module is the Nuxt/Content module. The Nuxt content module allows you to fetch content from different file types and import it into your site. This gives you what is essentially a git based CMS (content management system).

It allows us to write Markdown files and then parses that into usable content in our code. Here are some examples of how to format using Markdown.

`Inline code`

Block of code:
```
let x = 2 + 2
```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold Text**
*Italic Text*
> Block quote
